          <h3 class="doryHeader">Dory</h3>
            <p>Throughout the vast ocean you will not find a fish more hospitable, more friendly, and more sociable than Dory. She would love to chat with you all day and tell you her life story... but she can't. Dory suffers from short term memory loss. Dory is the aquatic Good Samaritan who offers to help Malin on his journey to find his son. She is certainly an odd partner for such a quest, but her optimism proves an invaluable quality to help overcome the impossible. To Dory, the glass is always half-full.</p>

          <h3>Malin</h3>
            <p>After losing his wife and family to the ocean, Malin is left alone to raise his only surviving child, Nemo. He struggles with his inability to let go of Nemo as his son begins school. When Nemo is suddenly taken away by scuba divers, Malin must try to find in himself the courage, wisdom, and faith needed to search the unpredictable ocean to bring his boy home - the very characteristics he needs to allow his son to learn and grow. Only then will he truly find Nemo.</p>

          <h3>Nemo</h3>
            <p>Nemo is a curious and impressionable six-year-old boy who lives alone with his overprotective, single-parent father, Malin. Having led a sheltered life, Nemo brims with the excitement of starting school and finally seeing the wonders of the Great Barrier Reef. Despite being born with a withered fin, Nemo yearns for adventure, and as fate takes him far from home, he learns he is capable of doing great things... like his father.</p>

          <h3>Bruce</h3>
            <p>Bruce is a great white shark in Finding Nemo. He is the leader of the Fish-Friendly Sharks support group.  Bruce is a kind and pleasant shark. He is also shown to be jolly, laid-back, and a jokester. However, his personality changes when his instincts start to kick in, and this makes him turn into a mindless, fish-eating shark (temporarily).</p>

          <h3>Gill</h3>
            <p>Gill's only dream is to escape from the tank. He had made several escape attempts, but the first time, he landed on dental tools, giving him severe scars on his right side, and destroying his right fin. He is the leader of the fish living inside the dentist's office fish tank called the Tank Gang. At the end of the film, Gill and the other Tank Gang members manage to escape from Dr. Sherman's office.</p>

          <h3>Crush</h3>
            <p>Crush is a sea turtle who speaks in the manner of a surfer dude. He helps Marlin and Dory get to Sydney Harbour to rescue Nemo. He nicknames Malin and Dory The Jellyman" and "Little Blue," respectively. After transporting Marlin and Dory on his shell to their destination and giving them the ride of their lives on the East Australian Current, after bidding each other goodbye, Marlin asks Crush how old he his, and Crush replies, "150, dude, and still young!" Probably the best way to describe Crush is a surfer punk who loves and cares for his son, Squirt.</p>

            <p>A plucky, playful sea turtle, Squirt idolizes his father, Crush, and has inherited his dad's fearless and easy-going attitude. With his spunky personality and big, expressive eyes, Squirt bubbles with joy, loves to frolic in the ocean currents and surf with his father. Squirt's high-spirited personality allows him to make friends easily and enjoy each day as an interesting, new adventure.</p>
