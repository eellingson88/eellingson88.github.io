          Years ago, in the Great Barrier Reef in the depths of the ocean off the coast of Australia, a happy Clown Fish couple welcomed hundreds of babies into the world. While the father, <a href="main_characters.html"> Marlin</a>, was frantically
          trying to figure out how he could adjust his budget to accommodate hundreds of new babies, he was also absolutely ecstatic about his new family. But suddenly, while Marlin's wife was recovering from the natural birth of hundreds of babies,
          a hungry barracuda invaded their home and destroyed their family. Marlin was left devastated, desperate, and a widower. But then, out of the corner of his eye, he noticed a glimmering egg. Everything that was left of his family. He was
          instantly in love with his child. He called him <a href="main_characters.html"> Nemo</a>.

          As Nemo grew up, Marlin was always extremely protective of Nemo. No matter what Nemo wanted to do, Marlin was always there to protect him. When Marlin finally let Nemo start school, Marlin came with him. But when Nemo decided to venture out into
          the deep sea during a class field trip, he ignored Marlin's attempt to stop him and keep him in the safety of the reef. Nemo swam too far out and was captured by a scuba diver! Marlin anxiously chased after the scuba diver to save his son, but it
          was too late. At the blink of an eye, Nemo was gone. The only clue left was a scuba mask that was left behind. On it, it said "P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney." The search had begun.

          Marlin embarks on a lengthy and challenging journey to find Nemo, searching the ocean far and wide. Meanwhile, Nemo is trapped in a fish tank in a dentist's office along with several other charismatic characters, such as <a href="main_characters.html">Gill</a>, a cynical yet secretly
          loving fish. On his journey, Marlin encountered a vegetarian Shark, <a href="main_characters.html">Bruce</a>, a surfer dude turtle, <a href="main_characters.html">Crush</a>, and
          Crush's adorable son, <a href="main_characters.html">Squirt</a>. But most importantly, Marlin befriended a forgetful fish named <a href="main_characters.html">Dory</a>. The only problem with Dory was her severe short-term memory loss. Although her condition initally seemed to only add to the difficulty,
          Marlin and Dory eventually were successful in finding and rescuing Nemo.
